# prefactor-cwl
CWL version of prefactor

https://github.com/lofar-astron/prefactor/

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gijzelaerr/prefactor-cwl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gijzelaerr/prefactor-cwl)

# requirements

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* A [CWL](http://www.commonwl.org/) runner (like [CWLtool](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool))
# usage


To run the pipeline with the example dataset just run:
```bash
$ make run
```

# steps

the pipeline consists of these steps:
